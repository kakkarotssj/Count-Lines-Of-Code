# Count-Lines-Of-Code
---

#### This python package provides a convenient class Calculate out of which you can use function count_lines that will go on in all subdirectories and files and calculate total number of lines except for files or directories that starts with either period(.) or underscore(_). Like me, if you guys are always eager about how much lines of code you have written. It will be a pretty handy module. A full working example is created in testing directory and in brief

### eg: 
### from main import Calculate
### Calculate('/Users/sid/Desktop/getToKnow/getToknow/testing')


## Note: Make sure to provide full path of your project
